## Inspiration
I thought about all the times I really didn't want to study, and how easily I forget things that I learned while bored. This game was made for the quackathon 2023 hackathon.

## What it does
It's a game based on geometry dash that runs in the terminal. Whenever you get killed, it asks you a question from a CSV you input. 

## How I built it
I used the curses library in python to take inputs and render the game to the terminal, and I used the csv library to read the CSV file.

## Challenges I ran into
The curses library is very difficult to use, and I had to learn it from scratch. The curses library also wasn't very stable, and I had to restart my terminal a few times. I have now made it safe.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I got something in that wasn't a buggy mess. I also got the game to run in the terminal, which is something I've never done before.

## What I learned
I learned how to use the curses library, to render to the terminal. I also learned how to use the csv library to read CSV files.

## What's next for Memorize
I may improve level generation and add more features like platforms.
